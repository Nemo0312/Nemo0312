I am actively involved in the SecretLab, a research group led by Dr. Anindya Maiti, which focuses on several key areas such as privacy and security, micromobility and urban planning, cyber-physical systems, information assurance, network security, and applied machine learning and artificial intelligence. My contributions include working on projects like ScooterLab (Funded by the National Science Foundation), which investigates smart transportation solutions through micromobility technologies. Through this involvement, I have gained experience in data management, network security, and the intersection of urban planning and emerging technologies. [ScooterLab](https://scooterlab.utsa.edu/)
