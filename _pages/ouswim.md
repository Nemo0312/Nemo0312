As a dedicated member of the OU Swim and Dive Team, I balance my academic pursuits with my passion for competitive swimming. Being part of the team has taught me discipline, time management, and the value of perseverance, which I apply to both my studies and my professional growth. Competing at the collegiate level has pushed me to continuously strive for improvement, both in and out of the pool, and fostered a strong sense of teamwork and camaraderie. Swimming remains a central part of my university experience, helping me maintain a healthy balance between physical fitness and academic success.
