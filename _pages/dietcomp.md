I am also a key contributor to Diet Companion, an AI-driven app designed to enhance users' dietary and fitness experiences, much like MyFitnessPal. In this project, my primary responsibilities focus on back-end development and database management. I ensure that user data is stored securely and processed efficiently, while also working closely with the team to integrate AI-based insights that guide users in achieving their fitness goals. This project has allowed me to deepen my expertise in web development, data security, and AI applications.
