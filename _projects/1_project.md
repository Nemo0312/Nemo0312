**Diet Companion** is an AI-driven health and nutrition tracking app, similar to *MyFitnessPal*, aimed at enhancing user experience through intelligent recommendations and data-driven insights. Our team focuses on creating a user-friendly interface that enables users to track their meals, workouts, and health goals with precision. As the backend and database developer, I’ve played a central role in ensuring seamless data management, from user data to detailed nutrition tracking.

With Diet Companion, users can effortlessly log their meals and receive personalized insights to help them achieve their health goals. We're working to integrate advanced machine learning algorithms that will analyze users’ diet habits and recommend optimal changes. Our main objective is to create a comprehensive platform that not only tracks nutrition but also adapts to user behavior, offering dynamic insights to improve overall health.


Our innovative AI system analyzes users’ inputs over time and generates tailored recommendations, making Diet Companion the go-to app for anyone looking to optimize their nutrition and fitness goals. With a backend that scales effectively and a reliable database architecture, we ensure the user experience remains uninterrupted and efficient, even as we continue to evolve the app’s features.

Expected closed beta is scheduled for December 2024.
